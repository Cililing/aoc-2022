# AOC-2022

## Running

Just run: `./gradlew run`
Run with benchmark enabled: `ENABLE_BENCHMARK=true ./gradlew run`

## Writing challenges

The main function tries to find all classes annotated with `Challange`.
Then creates them via reflection and trigger proper functions with time measurement.

Why so? Just wanted to make this a bit complicated. =) The second reason was that I wanted to create a framework (xD)
for running those. So I had to change the flow of control somehow ðŸ¤”

## Challenge structure

Each challenge must follow the structure:

```kotlin
@Challenge(day = 0) // challange day
class Day0 : BaseChallange<InputType> {

    override val inputPath = "input/day0.txt" // path with the input data

    // this method is invoked first, it maps the input (loaded as a list of string, each element is a new line in the file)
    // the method will be loaded at first, before calculation of ex1/ex2
    // to access the result (parsed input) refer to `input` variable (which is protected in the file)
    override fun parse(input: List<String>): List<InputType> {
        return input.map { InputType(input) }
    }

    override fun ex1(): String {
        return "ex1 result"
    }

    override fun ex2(): String {
        return "ex2 result"
    }
}
```

For an input "dayX.txt" the app will try to find a file "dayX_test.txt" (**file must have extension**) to run the
challenge against the test data.

The class may be annotated with `@Benchmark(n: Int)` as well. Then the app will execute the Challenge n-times to get the
average time. To run the benchmark you need to set a proper flag in the env (`enableBenchmark`).
